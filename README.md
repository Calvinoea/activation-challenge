### About 
For positive and inclusive growth to be achieved in blockchain networks, data must be aggregated and shared seamelessly while also being presented in ways that improve transprency of the markets.  Non-fungible tokens can help to increase the flow of DAO information through different verticals. 

NFTS can serve as a medium that bridges the gaps of knowledge about DAO activity and the blockchain ecosystem as a whole, allowing for a system of information sharing that improves transparency of decentralized organiation activity while incentivizing market participation for people of all experiences in blockchain. It builds bridges for the Web3 ecosystem and the different communities that it serves. In order for blockchain use-cases to be effectively implemented, information on blockchain technology and the information surrounding them must be understood. As understanding of the data is developed, more people will be able to connect with the blockchain network in new ways.

Non-fungible tokens serve as one of the most important ways by which bridges can be built for internal and external stakeholders of the decentralized technology ecosystem. A non-fungible token market, based on decentralized autonomous organization activity could help to increase engagement from external stakeholders with not only decentralizd autonomous organiztions but also with the larger blockchain ecosystem. 

The application could make it possible for people to easily support activities and events that DAOs are involved in by buying non-fungible tokens which represent their activities. With this medium of participation, people won't have to worry about the complex technologies behind blockhain networks. It allows for decentralized networks to be expanded beyond DAOs. In some ways, it could be compared to an auction house or museum of the decentralized finance sector where ideas on the future of the world with blockchain can be easily shared and bought into in ways that enable positive shared growth between different communities across the world.


# Local Setup
